# Nsma VPN
Access to freedom in the internet world only with one switch! Tap and wait until you find a proper server of hundreds of servers provided by [VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/), without worrying about government censorship.

It is enough to sign in with a **Gmail** account that is subscribed to the [VPN Gate Daily mirror site service](http://109.111.243.206:17579/en/mail.aspx), the app will do the rest and wait for its boss for a brief hint!

This VPN uses the implementation of [SSTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Tunneling_Protocol) protocol in the [Open SSTP Client](https://github.com/kittoku/Open-SSTP-Client) with slight changes.

## üîè Privacy Policy
You can read about it [here](https://nsmavpn.erfansn.ir/privacy_policy.html).

## üí° Features
- Easy to use only two steps, sign in then tap, and finally only one tap!
- There's no server for collecting and processing data, all stuff remains locally for better privacy.
- Turn on VPN, without launching the app by defining a [Quick Tile Settings](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/quicksettings-tiles) in the notification drawer.
- Allows you to split the tunnel for apps you don't want to use with the VPN traffic.
- Supports two languages **English** and **Persian**.
- Optimized for all types of screen sizes.

## üé® UI Design
The app's design system is based on [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), and inspired by designs for VPN apps by [Emmanuel Edokpa](https://dribbble.com/shots/16222592-TrueVPN-Mobile-App-Design/attachments/8084727?mode=media) and [Mohammad Reza Farahzad](https://dribbble.com/shots/14840886/attachments/6550059?mode=media), and by adding my own creativity, it is optimized for both dark and light modes.

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Build
Just follow the steps of [this link](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/legacy-gsi-start#configure-a-google-api-console-project) to get the `client id` and if you have created it for the debug key, replace it in this line:
https://github.com/erfansn/NsmaVPN/blob/4c01ec32bcc95c6f40c9e6b4892163f4ed9c4f48/app/build.gradle.kts#L67
otherwise:
https://github.com/erfansn/NsmaVPN/blob/4c01ec32bcc95c6f40c9e6b4892163f4ed9c4f48/app/build.gradle.kts#L76
And finally sync then build the project, that's it.

## üîÆ Future Plans
- [ ] Migrate the project to [KMP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) technology, especially for Windows Desktop platform support.
